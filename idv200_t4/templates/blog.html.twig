                        If you've been struggling with a fresh set of technical issues since the mid-September launch of
                        iOS 14 and WatchOS 7, Apple's got some potential fixes for you to try.

                        <br />
                        <br />

                        In a newly published support article, Apple runs through a list of issues that users of the new
                        operating system updates have faced in recent weeks. These include missing or inaccurate data in
                        health apps on iOS and WatchOS, those same apps not loading, and increased battery drain on
                        iPhone and Apple Watch.

                        <br />
                        <br />

                        In all, there are seven bullet-pointed issues listed in the support article. Apple notes that
                        users experiencing two or more of those issues should try a fairly involved set of steps that
                        could lead to a fix. Note that the process includes a system reset for your iPhone, so be ready
                        for that.

                        <br />
                        <br />

                        Apple asks users to unpair their phone and watch, then create an iCloud backup â€“ specifically
                        including your health data. Once that's done, you'll want to erase all settings and content from
                        your iPhone, after which you're clear to restore your backed up iPhone and Apple Watch data.

                        <br />
                        <br />

                        According to Apple, following these steps should "prevent future data loss." You can find the
                        specifics of each step laid out in much more detail in the support article.
